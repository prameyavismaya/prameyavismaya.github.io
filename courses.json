We will discuss the definition, look at various examples, and then go through the basic concepts like image, preimage, injections, surjections, bijections and more. We will also look at some foundational theorems on enumerative combinatorics (aka permutation and combination). Towards the end we will introduce the notion of the graph of a real valued function having real domain. Total Watch Duration: 5h 41m. Average Duration Per Video: 37m",
